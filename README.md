# -ALERT-AURA---WOMEN-SAFETY-APPLICATION
Our proposal is to create an AI-driven mobile application designed to autonomously respond to emergencies, specifically aimed at enhancing women's safety. This application integrates advanced machine learning models to process real-time data from diverse sources, including sensors, video feeds, speech samples, and location-specific crime history.
